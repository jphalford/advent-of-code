# Advent of Code 2021

2021, another very different year... but a lot closer back to normal so I haven't had as much chance to think about how to approach AoC this time around.

Once I've worked out what i'm doing i'll probably come back around and rewrite earlier problems to fit my chosen approach

## Breakdown
| Day | Title | Approach |
