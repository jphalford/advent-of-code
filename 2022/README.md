# Advent of Code 2021

2021, another very different year... but a lot closer back to normal so I haven't had as much chance to think about how to approach AoC this time around.

## Breakdown
| Day | Title | Approach |
|:---:|------|------------|
| 1 | Calorie Counting | Getting back into the groove with Python. |


## Day 1 - Calorie Counting

Getting back into the groove with Python. Thoughts and observations:
- iNeedToAdjustMyCodingStyle to_contain_more_underscores
- After several years of JUnit, being forced to write test_ in front of a test is irritating
- I miss streams/fluent iteration
